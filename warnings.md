Remote Nodes

Aeon-Wallet.net uses an outdated version and is therefore no longer compatible with newer versions. Using remote nodes offered there will no longer work.

Exchanges

HitBTC exchange has long refused to update wallet software after a hard fork and thus deposits and withdrawals were not possible, which makes it not very trustworthy. Use on your own risk.
